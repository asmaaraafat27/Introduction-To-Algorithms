||- Insertion sort running time as c1n*n (runs faster than merge sort for small input size->N),

While Merge sort running time as c2n*lgn (much smaller).


||- Exercises:

(1.2-2) ans: For n=1 -> merge sort beats insertion sort, but greater than that,

insertion sort will start to beat merge sort.


(1.2-3) ans: When n=15, explanation -> 100*(15)^2 = 22.500

While 2^(15) = 32.768.
